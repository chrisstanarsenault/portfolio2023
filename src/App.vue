        <div>
          <p>Hello! My name is Chris and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web
            development started
            back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog
            button
            taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

            Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge
            corporation,
            and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and
            digital
            experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

            I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API
            using Node &
            React.

            Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:</p>
